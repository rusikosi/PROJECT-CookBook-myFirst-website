  <h2>About my friend</h2>
  <p>When I was a teenager, my family was very poor. I needed pocket money, so I found a summer job as an assistant cook. <br>I worked for a summer in a restaurant and I really liked it. <br>The chef was a woman, she was very strict and knew everything about cooking, I admired her. <br>That's how I decided to get a chef's degree and tie myself to cooking forever</p>
